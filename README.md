# GitHub Users from Hyderabad with Over 50 Followers

- **How I scraped the data**: I used GitHub's REST API to search for users located in Hyderabad with more than 50 followers. For each user, I retrieved their public repositories using the API.
  
- **Most interesting finding**: The most surprising fact was that many users with over 50 followers had very few public repositories, showing a gap between follower count and active contribution.

- **Recommendation**: Developers should consider contributing to more open-source projects to increase their visibility on GitHub and attract more followers.
